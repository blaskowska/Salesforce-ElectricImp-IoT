# Salesforce IoT Project

Why not to try to integrate IoT with Salesforce? So, let's try! You can find here Salesforce design used in the integration of ElectricImp IoT device with Salesforce. We used platform event-triggered flow, connected app and custom object to store readings values.

The result of the project was presented by Barbara Laskowska and Manuel Moya during the Salesforce Community Event DreamOle 2023.
